# Requirement of TFIIH kinase subunit Mat1 for RNA Pol II C-terminal domain Ser5 phosphorylation, transcription and mRNA turnover

## Abstract
- Question: RNA Pol II C-terminal Ser5 phosphrylation: revelance not known
- Method: TFIIH kinase subunit Mat1 deletion in mice fibroblast
- Result: Reduced Pol II Ser5 phosphorylation, defective capping, reduced Ser2 phosphorylation, decreased Pol II preograssion into elongation, severely attenuated transcription, not relected in majority of steady-state mRNA
- Summary: Mat1 is required for transcription, stabliztion of mRNA following transcriptional attenuation.

## Introduction

**TFIIH**: Required *in vitro* for Pol II transcription
- Conserved 10 subunit protein complex. Core + CAK (Cdk-activating kinase)
	- Core: Melt promoter DNA during initiation
	- CAK: Cdk7, Cyclin H, Mat1. 

**Phosphorylation of Serine5 of Pol II CTD (C-terminal domain)**: proposed function of TFIIH
- 52 heptapeptide repeats with consensus sequence YSPTSPS
	- Sequential phosphorlation of serines 5 and 2 -> differential protein recruitment and regulation of specific co-transcription events
	- Ser5 phosphorylation: occurs at initiation, crucial for recruitment and activation of capping enzymes
		- Promotes recruitments of several elongation factors and chromatin modifiers in yeast and mammalian cells
		- Besides TFIIH kinase, Ser5 can be phosphorylated by at last Cdk9 / P-TEFb, and mediator kinase Cdk8 (proposed to be involved in recruitment of P-TEFb in mammalian cells)
	- Ser2 phosphorylation: coupled with capping

## Results

#### Mat1 is required for Pol II CTD phosphorylation in mouse fibroblasts

#### Deficient c-Fos and Hsp70 mRNA induction in Mat1-/- cells

#### Genome-wide alterations in mRNA levels follwing Mat1 deletion

#### Decrease RNA Pol II occupancy in gene bodies in Mat1-/- cells

#### Defective capping and splicing in Mat1-/- cells
*FU pulse-label*: 5'-fluorouridine 
*EU pulse-label*: 5'-ethynyluridine

#### Uncoupling of transcription and steady-state mRNA levels in Mat1-/- fibroblasts
