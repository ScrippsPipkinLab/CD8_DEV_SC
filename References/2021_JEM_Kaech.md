# The architectural design of CD8+ T cell responses in acute and chronic infection: Parallel structures with divergent fates

## 0. Objective
- Review of new insights into differentiation state dynamics and population heterogeneity of CD8 T cells in acute / chronic viral infection and cancer
- Highlight the parallels and distinctions between acute and chronic antigen stimulation settings
- Focus on transcriptional and epigenetic networks that modulate the plasticity and terminal differentiation of antigen-specific CD8 T cells

## 1. Intro
### 1.1 Heterogeneity is a universal feature of T cell differentiation, providing context-specific immunity
1.1.1 Two goals of T cell response to infection: 1) effector - large numbers of effector T cells to help eliminate the present infection; 2) memory.
1.1.2 Plasticity of T cell, especially naive T cells, describes ability of cells to readily transition from one state to another.
1.1.3 Complex diversity of cell types that arise in different settings of infection and disease (context -> differentiation program)
1.1.4 Regulators of differentiation / is there upper limit of cell fate that can be acquired?

*Defining cell type, cell states and cell fates*
> (a) Should different T cell subsets be considered distinct “cell types” or “cell fates”—or rather, “cell states”—based on their differ- entiation states? <br/> 
> (b) How does the stability of a differentiation state (stable vs. quasi-stable vs. transient) influence these definitions? <br/>
> (c) How should differences in signature genes, epigenetic states, functions, and migratory patterns be applied to these definitions?


## 2. CD8 T cell responses to acute and chronic infection

### 2.1 Acute infection
- 2.1.1 Initial activation:
	- Three signals: TCR, costimulation, cytokines
	- Asymetric division
	- Clonal expansion and TF expression (Runx3, T-bet, Eomes)
- 2.1.2 Effector: granzymes, perforin, cytokins (IL-2, IFNg, TNF), chemokines (CCL5, CCL3), chemokine receptors (CXCR3, CX3CR1, CXCR6, CCR5)
	- Highly specialized cytotoxic effector cells (TE): IFNg, GZMB, perforin, lose ability to produce IL-2 and TNF. Highest level of chemokines receptors (CX3CR1, S1PR5, KLRG1)  -> die
	- TE actively repress promemory genetic program (Il7ra, CD27)
	- Small fraction of TE-like cells persist into memory pool with some memory like features (LLE, long lived effector, terminal TEM)
- 2.1.3 Memory precursor: 
	- During expansion phase, EE downregulate IL-7Ra
	- MP: At the end of proliferative burst, small portion of cells begin to re-express Il7ra and display enhanced longevity and stem-like properties.
	- MP: less differentiated, increased IL-7Ra, Bcl2, Cd27, Cd28, Cxcr3
	- Comparing with TE, MP are more functionally heterogeneous and display greater proliferative capacity and **cytokine polyfunctionality** (IL-2, IFNg, TNF), but lower GZMB. 
	- DP: Some IL-7Rhi MPs also express high to intermediate amounts of CX3CR1 or KLRG1 concordant with greater amounts of cytotoxic molecules.
	- DP: Many of the MP cells are quite plastic and can be seen converting from one state to an- other during the resolution and contraction phase (and even much later at memory stages). This is especially evident in the effector cells that express intermediate amounts of CX3CR1int or DP cells that convert to KLRG1lo cells during contraction. 
- 2.1.4 Memory: diverse roles of memory cells
	- TEM & TRM: first line defense (blood, peripheral). TCM: focus on proliferation to resupply the host with large bursts of effector cells (secondary lymphoid organs)
	- *It is important to remember that these overly simple classifications do not accu- rately portray the broad phenotypic and functional heteroge- neity that exists in the memory T cell population, as nicely reviewed by Jameson and Masopust (2018)*
	- *The composition of memory CD8 T cells are not static. Rather, the composition of memory T cells is dynamic and changes with age, repeated infection, and environmental fluctuations (such as in- flammation) TCM <-> TEM <-> TRM*

### 2.2 Persistent infections: Chronic and latent infections
- 2.2.1 Exhaustion overview: (a) increased expression of multiple inhibitory receptors, such as PD1, TIM3, LAG3, CTLA4, and TIGIT, and (b) progressive loss of IL-2, TNF, and IFNγ secretion. 
	- While the increase in inhibitory receptor expression represses TCR signaling and proinflammatory effector functions in CD8+ T cells, it also appears to protect the cells from activation-induced cell death, as PD-1–deficient T cells fare poorly and deteriorate quickly.
	- Sustained Ca2+/nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) signaling leads to induction of the Tox -> exhaustion program.
	- Similar to acute infection, the CD8+ T cell response to chronic infection comprises multiple cell subsets that serve different roles in short- and long-term viral control. 
- 2.2.2 Texprog / Tstem / Texh mem (Akin to MP cells in acute): Increased Slamf6, Cxcr5 and decreased Tim3
	- Plasticity & proliferative capacity, can differentiate into transitory-intermediate (Texint) "effector-like" cells that up-regulate CX3CR1, Tbet and effector molecules (GZMB, IFNg, TNF)
	- Sustained production of Texint is critical to control chronic virus infection or tumor
- 2.2.2 Texint & Texterm
	- PD-1 blockade acts on Texprog by releasing their **proliferative restrains** and generating bursts of **Texint**. 
	- Texint further develop into Texterm, or Texpreg directly develop into Texterm. 
	- Texterm: higher PD-1, TIM3, CD101, CD39, CD160, impaired epxresion of effector related (TNF, IFN, GZMB, T-bet) and stemness and proliferation related (TCF1, MYB, MYC, Ki-67) proteins. 
- 2.2.3 *Not all chronic infections drive CD8+ T cell exhaustion phenotypes*
	- Latent viral infections followed by episodes of viral reactivation such as commonly seen by adenovirus or herpes viruses (HSV, EBV, CMV, and murine CMV), a mixed population with a variety of effector and memory subsets is formed.
	- CD8+ T cells recognizing latently produced antigens gradually expand over time and develop into a so-called “infla- tionary” memory cell pool that contains mostly CX3CR1hi KLRG1hi TE-like cells.

### 3. Comparative analysis of CD8 T cell differentiation trajectories during acute and chronic infection

### 3.1 Overview: effector differentiation programs begin to diverge between acute and chronic infection within the first week of infection.
- Effector cells in both acute and chronic LCMV infection are transcriptionally similar up to day 4.5 after infection (Yao 2019), but a significant transcriptional and epigenetic divergence begins a couple of days later and then continues for several more weeks.
- This time period coincides exactly with changes in the expression of the TOX, as it dwindles in antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in acute infection but becomes amplified in chronic infection and tumors
- Despite these clear divisions in the outcomes of CD8+ T cell fates during acute versus chronic infection, the underlying structure of the T cell differentiation programs ap- pears quite similar between the two types of infections.

### 3.2 Shared features of T cell differentiaion in actue and chronic infection
- 3.2.1 Core purpose:
	- To generate progenitor cells that sustain the pool of virus- specific CD8+ T cells long-term
	- TO regenerate effector cells to battle viral-infected cells when present. 
- 3.2.2 Localization: 
	- Precursor cells in both infection settings (Texprog and MP) prefer to home to lymphoid zones (e.g., white pulp in spleen, lymph nodes, or tertiary lymphoid organs)
	- CX3CR1-expressing effector-like cells (TE and Texint) are pre-dominantly found in the blood.
	- Texterm and TRM also seem to have tissue homing in common, and both express CXCR6 and CD69.
- 3.2.3 Transcription:
	- Texprog and MP express high Tcf7, Foxo1, and Bach2
	- TE and Texint express Tbx21 (encoding T-bet) and Zeb2
	- Texterm and TRM express Prdm1, Id2, Nr4a2, Bhlhe40, and Tox 
- 3.2.4 Teriminal differentiation:
	- Acute: TE (KLRG1hi CX3CR1hi IL-7Ralo CD27lo)
	- Chronic: Texterm (CD101hi TIM3hi SLAMF6lo)

### 3.3 Distinctive features of T cell differentiation in acute and
chronic infection
*KLRG1hi TE cells do not generate Texterm cells when restimulated*
- Many similarities between transcriptional states of TE and Texint
- TE cells are terminally differentiated, whereas Texint cells are intermediary and not yet terminally differentiated.
- KLRG1 is expressed by LCMV specific TE-like CD8+ T cells during the first week of chronic infection, but these KLRG1hi cells rapidly wane and are highly dependent on CD4+ T cell help. The inability of KLRG1hi TE cells to persist in chronic infection may be because these cells are highly sensitive to activation-induced cell death and/or because TOX antagonizes T-bet and impairs maximal T-bet induction and TE cell induction, which circumvents terminal differentiation into TE cells.
- Even though exhausted HIV- or HCV- specific T cells in humans express KRLG1, they show significant reduction in T-bet expression. TOX may help to endow Texint cells with plasticity to continue differentiating into Texterm cells.

## 4 Transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of CD8+ T cell heterogeneity during acute and chronic infection

### 4.1 Active maintenance of plasticity and terminally differentiated states in CD8+ T cells
- 4.1.1 Overview: 
	- CD8 T cell differentiation states arise with coordinated action of multiple TFs and chromain remodling complexes that generate Feed-Forward circuits to promote one cell state while opposing another
	- Some states are more stable, perhaps represent epigenetic metabolic equilibrium
- 4.1.2 TE differentiation is stepwise
	- In EE: Induction of T-bet, Zeb2, Stat4, Rbpj, Irf4, Blimp- 1 (Prdm1), and Id2, repression of promemory TFs (such as Tcf7, Bach2, Bcl6, Id3, Foxo1, Zeb1, and Stat3)
	- Developing TE epigenetically repress promemory genes via H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 and DNA methylation on promemory genes by the enzymes EZH2, SUV39H1, and DNMT3a.
	- Epigenetic remodeling likely occurs several days after initial transcriptional repression of promemory genes that begins as early asfirst division.
	- EE might begin to commit to TE, but determination to TE state is not achieved until several days after.
- 4.1.3 Memory
	- MP is poised for effector while promote memory
	- MP maintain promemory, prosurvial and many TE-signature gene loci in active or permissive epigenetic states
	- TCM and TEM cells maintain poised and bivalent epigenetic marks
	- TCM and TEM activate H3K4me3 and repress H3K27me3, on the promoter regions of Id2, Tbx21, Eomes, Irf4, Map3k1, Mlk4, and Mkx
	- Bivalency allow rapid transition from resting state.
	- Memory cell plasicity depends on Foxo1 and exposure to cytokines via TGFβ receptor
		- Foxo1: EZH2-mediated silencing by locally impairing H3K27me3 deposition at such loci
		- Foxo1: recruiting DNA-demethylase machinery because the selective loss of DNA methylation at promemory-associated loci such as Sell (CD62L) and Tcf7 was observed in MP cells, but not TE cells
- 4.1.4 TE status has to be maintained with sustained ID2 expression
*When ID2 was deleted after day 8 of acute virus infection, the KLRG1hi TE cells rapidly converted into MP-like cells.*

### 4.2 Imprinting CD8+ T cell exhaustion

- 4.2.1 Key requirements of Tex formation
	- Chronic TCR signaling: core mechanistic driver of functional exhaustion, via calcineurin- dependent TF, NFAT, and other NFAT-driven, TCR-responsive TFs such as IRF4, BATF, nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A (NR4A), and TOX
	- TF requirement: The formation and maintenance of Texprog cells depend on TOX, but also on TFs found in memory cells and their precursors, such as TCF1 (en- coded by Tcf7) and FOXO1 
- 4.2.2 Texprog -> Texint transition
	- Associated with proliferation and induction of Tbx21, Zeb2, Cx3Cr1, and S1pr5
	- Cells continue to convert into CD101hi Texterm cells and progressively methylate the DNA and silence Ifng, Tcf7, and Tbx21.
	- In contrast, the promoters of Pdcd1, Lag3, and Havcr1 (encoding TIM3) and Cd101 are demethylated and further up-regulated.
	- De novo methylation of effector loci by DNMT3a is critical for commitment to exhaustion by silencing effector- and memory-related gene loci.
	- The epigenetic stability of the exhaustion program is remarkably robust. Anti- PD-1 treatment, this therapy is unable to reprogram the epigenetic landscape of Tex cells to that of an effector or memory state

### 5. How does the same TF specify distinct differentiation states?
- 5.1 Multitasker TFs are used repeatedly to generate multiple types of differentiation states
	- T-bet & Zeb2: TE & Texint
	- Nr4a1, Nr4a2, Prdm1, Irf4, and Tox: TRM & Texterm
	- Eomes: TE, TCM, Texterm
	- *How does a CD8+ T cell commit to one cell fate over another if similar TFs are being used?*
- 5.2 What are the context-dependent specifiers that differentially control the activity of the same TF in discrete differentiation states?
	- *TFs can be understood as nodes in neural network. The weights associated with TFs determine the contextual function*
	- TF gradient: differential function at different concentration e.g. T-bet, Tox
	- Localization of TF: e.g. T-bet nuclear localization
	- Posttranslational modifications
