## Abstract
- Background: Exhausted T cells: replenished by Tprecursor (TCF1)
- Result: 
	- High antigen load promote differentiation of Tprecursor
	- Early precursor showed epigenetic imprinting characteristic of TCR dependent transcription factor binding
	- Tprecursor restricted to generation of cells displaying exhaustion characteristics
	- BACH2 & BATF: opposing functions in generation of Tprecursor

## Introduction
- TCF1+ cells in exhausted pool (TPEX)
	- Lack TIM-3, retain high proliferative potential, undergo self-renewal, replenish TCF1-
	- Features of exhaustion: high expression of Tox and PD-1, impaired ability to produce cytoines

- CX3CR1 and exhausted T cells
	- TCF1- CX3CR1+ exhausted T cells are immediate progeny of TPEX
		- Highest effector function
	- CXCR1-: terminally exhausted state
		- Effector function diminished

## Results
### T cells differentiate into early precursor and effector cells (Fig1)
*TCF1- TIM3+: TE; TCF1+ TIM3-: TP (precursor T cell)*
- Docile versus Arm:
	- 1-8 division TP%: Docile > Arm 
	- 5-21 days TP%: day5 Docile > Arm, after Arm > Docile
- Titrated doses of LCMV Docile
	- Increased dose -> larger frequencies of early TP
- Reduce antigen amount of GP33 (mixed chronic LCMV infection):
	- Reduced TP%

### Reduced effector function of early TP cells (Fig2)
- TP versus TE:
	- Higher Tox
	- Lower IFNg
- Titration dose of Docile
	- Lower dose of Docile -> higher IFNg in TP
	- Lower dose of Docile -> n.s. difference in IFGg in TE
- Conclusion:
	- TCF1+ precursors, not effectors are the first to acquire features of T cell exhaustion during chronic infection

### ID3 demarcates precursor T cells in acute and chronic infection (Fig3)
- ID3 expression in Arm and Doc:
	- TIM3- TP cells: elevated ID3 expression
	- TIM3+ TE cells: lacked ID3 expression
-  Co expression of other factors:
	- TCF1, Ly108, CXCR5 co-express with ID3
- Arm versus Doc:
	- TCF1 more broadly expressed, including ID3+ and ID3 in acute infction (Arm). 
	- TCF1 co-expressed with ID3 in chronic infection (Doc).

### TP cells acquire transcriptional features of exhaustion first (Fig4)
- RNAseq analysis
	- PCA & hierarchical clustering: 
		- Samples: Doc / Arm, ID3+ / ID3-, d5 / d12 / d21
		- Arm d5-d21 and Doc d5 ID3- clustered together
		- Doc d5 ID3+ and Doc d5-21 all samples clustered together

### Epigenetic profile of early TP cells (Fig5)
- ATACseq analysis
	- PCA & hierarchical clustering:
		- Samples: Doc / Arm, ID3+ / ID3-, d5 / d12 / d21
		- ID3- Doc more similar with Arm samples
		- ID3+ Doc clustered together

### BACH2 and BATF regulate early TP cell differentiation (Fig6)
- Motif enrichment TP versus TE:
	- TCF1, Jun-AP1, NFAT: AP1, BACH2: more in TP
	- TBET, EOMES: more in TE
- Bach2: more highly expressed in TP
- Bach2-/-
	- TP% reduced
	- TP# decreased (52x)
	- TE# decreased (22x)
	- PD-1 n.s.
	- Tox n.s.
- Bach2oe
	- TP% increased
	- TP# decreased (4x)
	- TE# decreased (293x)
	- PD-1 reduced
	- Tox reduced
- Batf -/-
	- TE% decreased
	- TP# decreased (11x)
	- TE# decreasd (42x)
	- PD-1 reduced
	- Tox reduced

### Exhaustion is imprinted in early TP cells (Fig7)
- Sort transfer: d5 Arm / Doc, TE / TP -> Naive recipient LCMV Arm
	- PD1, Tox: Doc TP > TE
- Sort transfer: d5 Arm / Doc, TE / TP (Id3 GFP donor) -> Infection matched Doc recipient
	- CX3CR1+ cells direct progeny of TCF1+:
		- Doc TP < Arm TP
