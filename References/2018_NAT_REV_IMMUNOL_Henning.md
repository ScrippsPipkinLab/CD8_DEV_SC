## Key points
- Linear differentiation model: progressive changes to gene expression & epigenetic landscape
- DNA methylation, histone modification and chromatin architecture: major epigenetic mechanisms that regulate CD8 T cell differentiation and function -> allow for signal-driven establishment and heritable maintenance of transcriptional changes
- Epigenetic modifying proteins can act differntially within CD8+ T cell differentiation subsets to regulate gene expression. Altering activities of these enzymes can have profound effects on T cell differentiation and function.
- T cell exhaustion represents a state of arrested differentiation. Reversal of T cell exhaustion liberates effector function but may negatively impact the persistence of antigen-specific T cells.

## Abstract
- Background: Epigenetic states that underlie the changes occur during CD8 T cell differentiation are not comletely understood.
- Focus: 
	- Epigenetic modification of DNA and associated histone at gene & regulatory elements
	- Structural changes in chromatin organization that affect gene expression
	- Translational potential of epigenetic interventions to improve CD8+ T cell function in individuals

## Introduction
-CD8+ T cell differentiation states
	- Models
		- Circular model
		- Linear model

## 1. Epigenetic changes during differentiation
*Epigenetic changes during T cell differentiation: 1) drive differentiation, 2) maintain expression patterns following signal withdrawal*
*Epigenetic modification is binary at level of individual allele -> signals obtained from studies refelect changes in frequency of a particular epigenetic modification across pool of allels for a given locus within investigated cell populations*
